## Introduction:
Django provides a robust transaction management system that allows you to group database operations into atomic blocks. These blocks ensure that either all changes are committed successfully or none at all. In this repository, we explore how to leverage transactions effectively.

## Why Use Transactions?
- Data Consistency: Transactions prevent partial updates, ensuring that your database remains consistent.

- Error Handling: Rollbacks occur automatically if an exception is raised within a transaction.

- Concurrency Control: Transactions help manage concurrent access to shared resources.

## Atomicity in Django:

By default, Django runs in autocommit mode, where each query is immediately committed unless a transaction is active. However, you can explicitly control transactions using the atomic() context manager.

## Using Transactions:

## Best Practices:
- Keep transactions short and focused.

- Avoid long-running transactions.

- Understand the difference between atomic() and commit_on_success().
